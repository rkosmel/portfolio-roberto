I want to share a project that gave me a lot of hands-on experience taking something from zero to a stable production deployment.

Over the past months, I worked on building and publishing the **Blue Exams** landing page — focusing on performance, clear messaging, and basic SEO structure.

What I did (high-level):
- Built the page (HTML/CSS/JS) with UX and fast load times in mind
- Added basic SEO pieces (robots/sitemap)
- Deployed to **AWS EC2** served via **Nginx**
- Kept the deployment process simple and predictable

Stack:
- HTML/CSS/JS (vanilla)
- AWS EC2 + Nginx + Let’s Encrypt (TLS)

For confidentiality, I don’t share proprietary code or internal details, but I’m happy to discuss decisions and learnings.

Open to **Junior Full-Stack** roles (primary) and **Junior Cloud/DevOps** roles (secondary).\n\n#aws #nginx #webdev #fullstack #devops
