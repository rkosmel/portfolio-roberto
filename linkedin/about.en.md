I'm a developer with hands-on experience in production web applications, focusing on end-to-end delivery with emphasis on stability, maintainability, and real business impact.

I worked on projects like Blue Exams, The Mindville, and MBA No Brainer, participating from conception through deployment and operations, using React/Next.js, Node.js (Express), PostgreSQL/Prisma, authentication (NextAuth), payments (Stripe), and infrastructure on AWS, Linux/Nginx, and Docker.

I have a hands-on profile, enjoy understanding problems holistically and taking technical responsibility for the solutions I develop. Open to new challenges in systems development, especially in environments that value autonomy, continuous learning, and technical quality.

Remote, hybrid, or in-person work in the São José dos Campos and São Paulo regions.
