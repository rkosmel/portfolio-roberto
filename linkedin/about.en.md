I'm a Junior Full-Stack developer with hands-on experience in production web applications, focused on end-to-end delivery and stability.

I worked on projects such as Blue Exams, The Mindville, and MBA No Brainer using React/Next.js, Node.js (Express), and PostgreSQL/Prisma, plus authentication (NextAuth), payments (Stripe), and operations on AWS (EC2/RDS/S3), Linux/Nginx, and Docker.

I'm looking for Junior Full-Stack roles (primary) and Junior Cloud/DevOps roles (secondary). Open to remote, hybrid, or in-person work in the São José dos Campos regional area and São Paulo regional area.
