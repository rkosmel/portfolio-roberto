I’m a Junior Full-Stack developer with hands-on experience in production web applications, focused on end-to-end delivery and stability.

I worked on projects such as Blue Exams, The Mindville, and MBA No Brainer using Next.js/React, Node/NestJS, and PostgreSQL/Prisma, plus authentication (NextAuth), subscriptions (Stripe), and operations on AWS (EC2/RDS/S3), Linux/Nginx, and Docker.

I’m looking for Junior Full-Stack roles (primary) and Junior Cloud/DevOps roles (secondary). Open to remote work or hybrid in São José dos Campos, SP (Brazil).
