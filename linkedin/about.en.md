I’m a Junior Full-Stack developer with hands-on experience delivering web applications and operating production workloads in the cloud.

I worked on projects such as Blue Exams, The Mindville, and MBA No Brainer, using Next.js/React, Node/NestJS, PostgreSQL/Prisma, and integrations (e.g., payments), plus production deployment and maintenance (AWS EC2, Nginx, Docker, RDS, S3).

I’m looking for Junior Full-Stack roles (primary) and Junior Cloud/DevOps roles (secondary). Open to remote work or hybrid in São José dos Campos, SP (Brazil).
