One of the most challenging projects I worked on recently was building and evolving a web-based exam simulation platform with a **subscription** model — aiming to replicate the Executive Assessment experience.

Key hands-on learnings:
- Data modeling and user access flows
- Authentication and authorization integration
- Subscription billing integration
- Production debugging with a strong focus on stability and user impact

High-level stack:
- Next.js + React
- NextAuth (auth)
- Stripe (subscriptions)
- PostgreSQL + Prisma

For confidentiality, I don’t share company code — but I wrote a high-level case study with architecture and learnings.

Open to Junior Full-Stack and Junior Cloud/DevOps opportunities.
