A big part of my recent experience was contributing to an existing B2B product — and learning how to evolve software without breaking critical flows.

At **The Mindville**, I contributed to full-stack deliveries involving the dashboard and backend, with hands-on database work and troubleshooting.

High-level takeaways:
- Frontend on **Next.js** organized as a **monorepo (npm workspaces)**
- Two apps (production and demo) sharing packages (core/ui)
- Backend on **NestJS** with **Prisma + PostgreSQL**
- Layered data model (Bronze/Silver/Gold) for metrics and snapshots

This experience improved my consistency in:
- reading and navigating existing codebases
- incremental refactoring
- impact-driven debugging
